Entity Relationships
A User can own multiple Properties (1-to-many)

A User can make multiple Bookings (1-to-many)

A Booking is associated with one Property and one User (many-to-1)

A Property can have multiple Reviews (1-to-many)

A Booking is linked to one Payment (1-to-1)


## üß© Feature Breakdown
The Airbnb Clone project replicates key functionalities of the Airbnb platform. Below is a list of core features that form the backbone of the system:

1. User Management
Allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles. Users can be guests or hosts, each with role-specific permissions and dashboards.

2. Property Management
Enables hosts to list new properties, update details (such as title, description, location, price), and upload images. Each property is linked to the host‚Äôs account and viewable by guests.

3. Booking System
Facilitates reservation of properties by guests. It manages availability checks, date selections, and links bookings to users and properties.

4. Payment Integration
Handles payment processing for confirmed bookings. Ensures secure transactions, generates receipts, and tracks payment statuses for both hosts and guests.

5. Review & Rating System
Lets guests leave reviews and rate properties after completing their stay. Helps other users make informed booking decisions based on previous experiences.

6. Search and Filter Functionality
Users can search for properties by location, date, price range, and property type. This improves the user experience and makes property discovery seamless.

7. Admin Dashboard (Optional)
An interface for system administrators to manage users, oversee listings, resolve disputes, and monitor platform activity.


## üîê API Security
Securing the backend APIs is critical to protecting user data, ensuring system integrity, and maintaining trust. The following security measures will be implemented:

1. Authentication
We will implement token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) to verify the identity of users accessing the system. This ensures that only registered users can log in and interact with their data or perform authorized actions.

2. Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) will be used to restrict access to different parts of the application based on the user's role (guest, host, admin). For example, only hosts can add or edit property listings, while only guests can make bookings.

3. Input Validation and Sanitization
All incoming data will be validated and sanitized to prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS). This keeps both user data and server logic safe from manipulation.

4. Rate Limiting
Rate limiting will be applied to API endpoints to prevent abuse, such as brute-force login attempts or spammy requests. This helps maintain system performance and guards against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

5. Secure Data Transmission
All communications with the backend will use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit. This ensures that sensitive information like passwords and payment data isn‚Äôt exposed to potential attackers.

6. Payment Security
Integration with a secure and compliant payment gateway (e.g., Stripe or PayPal) ensures that financial data is handled by trusted providers, reducing risk and ensuring PCI-DSS compliance.

Why API Security Matters
Protecting User Data: Ensures that sensitive information such as personal details and login credentials are safe.

Securing Financial Transactions: Prevents unauthorized access to payment data and fraudulent transactions.

Maintaining System Trust: A secure system helps build and retain trust among users, encouraging long-term engagement.

Ensuring Legal Compliance: Adhering to security standards ensures compliance with data protection laws like GDPR.

## CI/CD Pipeline
What is a CI/CD Pipeline?
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (or Continuous Delivery). A CI/CD pipeline is a set of automated processes that allow developers to automatically test, build, and deploy applications. The primary goal is to speed up the development lifecycle by automating repetitive tasks such as testing, building, and deployment.

Continuous Integration (CI) involves automatically integrating code changes into a shared repository multiple times a day. Each integration triggers an automated process that builds and tests the code to ensure new changes don‚Äôt break the application.

Continuous Deployment (CD) automatically deploys changes to a production environment once they pass the CI tests. Continuous Delivery, an alternative, allows for manual intervention before deployment but ensures that the code is always ready for release.

Importance for the Project
CI/CD pipelines ensure that every code change is tested and integrated consistently, improving code quality and reducing the risk of errors in production. By automating the build, test, and deployment processes, it reduces manual intervention, increases productivity, and accelerates the release cycle.

Tools for CI/CD
Several tools are commonly used to set up CI/CD pipelines:

GitHub Actions: A powerful tool integrated with GitHub to automate tasks like testing, building, and deploying code directly from a repository.

Docker: Used to containerize applications, ensuring that they run consistently in different environments (e.g., development, staging, and production).

Jenkins: An open-source automation server that can be configured to handle the CI/CD pipeline, including testing and deployment tasks.

Travis CI: A cloud-based tool for continuous integration and deployment that works well with GitHub repositories.

CircleCI: A continuous integration and delivery platform that automates software testing and deployment.
