# Airbnb Clone Project

## üè† Overview
This project is a simplified clone of the Airbnb platform, built as part of the ALX Software Engineering program. It aims to demonstrate core full-stack development skills including front-end design, back-end logic, data modeling, and version control.

## üéØ Project Goals
- Recreate the basic functionality of Airbnb‚Äôs web application
- Apply object-oriented programming principles
- Implement persistent storage using file and database backends
- Build web interfaces using HTML/CSS and Flask
- Practice collaborative software development with Git and GitHub

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Frameworks**: Flask (for web), unittest (for testing)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub
- **Tools**: VS Code, Linux, Pep8

## üìÇ Directory Structure (Coming Soon)
The repo will include modules for the console, models, views, and static assets.
