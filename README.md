A Booking is linked to one Payment (1-to-1)


## üß© Feature Breakdown
The Airbnb Clone project replicates key functionalities of the Airbnb platform. Below is a list of core features that form the backbone of the system:

1. User Management
Allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their profiles. Users can be guests or hosts, each with role-specific permissions and dashboards.

2. Property Management
Enables hosts to list new properties, update details (such as title, description, location, price), and upload images. Each property is linked to the host‚Äôs account and viewable by guests.

3. Booking System
Facilitates reservation of properties by guests. It manages availability checks, date selections, and links bookings to users and properties.

4. Payment Integration
Handles payment processing for confirmed bookings. Ensures secure transactions, generates receipts, and tracks payment statuses for both hosts and guests.

5. Review & Rating System
Lets guests leave reviews and rate properties after completing their stay. Helps other users make informed booking decisions based on previous experiences.

6. Search and Filter Functionality
Users can search for properties by location, date, price range, and property type. This improves the user experience and makes property discovery seamless.

7. Admin Dashboard (Optional)
An interface for system administrators to manage users, oversee listings, resolve disputes, and monitor platform activity.
